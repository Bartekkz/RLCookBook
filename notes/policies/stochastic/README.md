# Stochastic policies
## Most used stochastic policies
The two most common kinds of stochastic policies in deep RL are _____categorical policies__ and
__diagonal Gaussian policies__.
## Key computations for using and training stochastic policies
* __sampling__ actions from the policy
* computing __log likelihoods__ of particaular actions
In subdirections I discuss both __sampling__ and __log likelihoods__ for each stochastic policy
