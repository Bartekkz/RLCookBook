### Basics Questions and answers
#### 1) What is Reinforcement learning in general and how it differs from other machine learning methods
In a nutshell Reinforcement learning is the training of machine learning models to make a sequence of decisions. The agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain, potentially complex environment. It differs from supervised learning in terms of supervisor. Unlike in supervised learning we do not give an agent an explicit encoded information what to do. Agent should learn what to do by himself while for example playing the game and reciving rewards corresponding to the actions he have chosen. That is the main differnce between RL and other ML methods.
