Implementation of various Reinforcement Learning algorithms

### Basics Questions and answers
#### 1) What is Reinforcement learning in general and how it differs from other machine learning methods
In a nutshell Reinforcement learning is the training of machine learning models to make a sequence of decisions. The agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain, potentially complex environment. It differs from supervised learning in terms of supervisor. Unlike in supervised learning we do not give an agent an explicit encoded information what to do. Agent should learn what to do by himself while for example playing the game and reciving rewards corresponding to the actions he have chosen. That is the main differnce between RL and other ML methods.

#### 2) What You can (or will) find in this repo?
The main goal of this project is to have a place where You can look up if You are new to reinforcement learning or You just want
a quick reminder about mathematical background of various RL methods or want to check python implementation of them.

#### 3) What is the source of theoretical notes(especially mathematical equations and transformations?)
All the informations I gathered so far that I am going to include in this repo I writed down while watching DeepMind lectures from
2015. You can find them here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ). The rest will be
from OpenAI "Spinning UP" which You can find here (https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/user/introduction.html#what-this-is). I highly recommend to go through both lecture series (DeepMind) and reading/coding materials (OpenAI).

#### 4) What is the plan of releasing notes and implementations?
Basically I am gonna post several implementations of "standard" algortithms and what I mean by that is that those are not belong to so 
called "Deep Reinforcement Learning" which means that they are not using neural nets for approximations. But we are gonna find out it later.
